# Responsive tables

## What is it?

A simple webapp that takes user input to find your Google Drive spreadsheet key and column formatting information, then generates a .zip with a ready-for-deployment responsive table and all required assets.

It works best with tables that have 5-7 columns.

## Usage

### Setup

Install this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/INN/responsive-tables.git

[Publish](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/37579?authuser=0) your Google Spreadsheet.

### Configuration

Copy `config-example.json` to `config.json`. Open `config.json` and add your spreadsheet's key. The key is a long sequence of apparently-random characters, such as `10yccwbMYeIHdcRQazaNOaHSkpoSa1SUJEtWBfWPsgx0`, found in the URL of the page you use to edit the spreadsheet. An example URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10yccwbMYeIHdcRQazaNOaHSkpoSa1SUJEtWBfWPsgx0/edit#gid=0, which was used to generate [this embedded example](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/discounts/). The key may include dashes. The key is also included in the URL found in the "Document link" field of the [Publish to web](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965/?hl=en&authuser=0) dialog. 

Fill in `title` to set the table's title tag.

Fill in `ua_code` to enable Google Analytics.

    {
        "ua_code": "googleanalyticsuacodegoeshere",
        "title": "Title tag",
        "key": "yourspreadsheetkeygoeshere",
    ...

Next, define the columns to display in your table. For example:

    ...
        "columns": [
          ["tool", "Tool"],
          ["category", "Category"],
          ["typeofresource", "Type of resource"],
          ["developingmember", "Developing member"],
          ["description", "Description"],
          ["url", "link"],
          ["notes", "notes"]
        ]
    }

Each item in the `columns` array follows the format `["simplifiedlabel", "Label for display"]`. Simplified labels are the column headings in your document with spaces and underscores removed, and uppercase letters made lowercase. Allowed characters are lowercase a-z, numbers, and the `-` character. 

## Deploying to server

Copy the contents of the `build` zip to a directory on your website.

## Embedding the table

We're using [pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/) to make our tables responsive when embedded via iframe.

To embed a table, you can use this snippet to get started:

    <div id="table-iframe-container"></div>
    <script src="http://yourdomain.com/path/to/pym.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    (function() {
      var pymParent = new pym.Parent(
        'table-iframe-container',
        'http://yourdomain.com/path/to/index.html', {});
    }());
    </script>

Be sure to replace `http://yourdomain.com/path/to/index.html` with the actual URL of your table, and to replace `http://yourdomain.com/path/to/pym.js` with the location of the `pym.js` file, found in the same directory.

## Troubleshooting

**Data in wrong column**:

Are the simplified labels in your `config.json` composed only of lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes?

**No data shows**:

Is your spreadsheet [published](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965?rd=1&authuser=0)?
